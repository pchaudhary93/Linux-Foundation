Lab 13 How to Use Multiple Commands in a Single Line


We can execute multiple independent commands in a single line by using the following two ways 


1st Way: By using semicolon (;) 


cmd1;cmd2;cmd3;.....;cmdn 
First cmd1 will be executed and then cmd2 followed by rest of the commands. 
If any command fails in the middle, still rest of the commands will be executed. 




2nd Way: By using && 
cmd1 && cmd2 && cmd3 &&..... && cmdn 


First cmd1 will be executed and then cmd2 followed by rest of the commands. 
If any command fails in the middle, then rest of the commands won't be executed. 


Eg: 
create a directory dir1 
create files a.txt,b.txt,c.txt in that dir1 
write current system date and time to a.txt 
write current month calendar to b.txt 


mkdir dir1 ; touch dir1/{a,b,c}.txt ; date > dir1/a.txt ; cal > dir1/b.txt 



mkdir dir1 && touch dir1/{a,b,c}.txt && date > dir1/a.txt && cal > dir1/b.txt
