Lab 14 Regular Expressions and Wildcard Characters


If we want to represent a group of strings according to a particular pattern, then we should go for regular expressions. 


By using wildcard characters, we can build regular expressions. 
A wildcard character can be used as a substitute for required sequence of characters in the 
regular expression. 


1) ğŸ¡ª Represents zero or more characters 
2) ? ğŸ¡ª Represents only one character 
3) []ğŸ¡ª Range of characters 
4) [abc] ğŸ¡ª Either a or b or c 
5) [!abc] ğŸ¡ªAny character except a,b and c 
6) [a-z] ğŸ¡ª Any lower case alphabet symbol 
7) [A-Z] ğŸ¡ª Any upper case alphabet symbol 
8) [a-zA-Z] ğŸ¡ª Any alphabet symbol 
9) [0-9] ğŸ¡ª Any digit from 0 to 9 
10) [a-zA-Z0-9] ğŸ¡ª Any alphanumeric character 
11) [!a-zA-Z0-9] ğŸ¡ª Except alpha numeric character (i.e special symbol) 
12) [[:lower:]] ğŸ¡ª Any lower case alphabet symbol 
13) [[:upper:]] ğŸ¡ª Any upper case alphabet symbol 
14) [[:alpha:]] ğŸ¡ª Any alphabet symbol 
15) [[:digit:]] ğŸ¡ª Any digit from 0 to 9 
16) [[:alnum:]] ğŸ¡ª Any alpha numeric character 
17) [![:digit:]] ğŸ¡ª Any character except digit 
18) {} ğŸ¡ª List of files with comma separator 


Following are some wild card character:-


1. To list out all files present in current working directory ğŸ¡º $ ls * 


2. To list out all files with some extension ğŸ¡º $ ls *.* 

3) To list out all files starts with a ğŸ¡º $ ls a* 


4) To list out all files starts with a and ends with t ğŸ¡º $ ls a*t 


5) To list out all files where file name contains only 2 characters and first character should be 'a'  ğŸ¡º $ ls a? 


6) To list out all files where file name contains only 3 characters ğŸ¡º $ ls ??? 


7) To list out all files where file name contains at least 3 characters ğŸ¡º $ ls ???* 


8) To list out all files where file name starts with a or b or c ğŸ¡º $ ls [abc]* 


9) To list out all files where file name should not starts with a, b and c ğŸ¡º $ ls [!abc]* 


10) To list out all files starts with lower case alphabet symbol 
$ ls [a-z]* 


11) To list out all files starts with digit. 
$ ls [0-9]* 



Note: We can use these wildcard characters with the following commands also. 
cp, mv, rm 


1) To copy all files starts with digit to dir1 directory. 
$cp [[:digit:]]* dir1 


$cp [0-9]* dir1 


2) To move all files starts with alphabet symbol and with .txt extension to dir2 directory? 
$mv [[:alpha:]]*.txt dir2 


3) Remove all files starts with a or b or c and ends with e or t. 
$rm [abc]*[et]
