Lab 16 Compression and Uncompression of files (tar, gzip, bzip2, bunzip2)


As part of admin activity, it is a very common requirement to pack and compress a group of files. The main advantages are: 
1) It improves memory utilization 
2) Transportation will become very easy 
3) It reduces download times 


This process involves the following 2 activities: 
1) Creation of Archive file 
2) Apply compression algorithms on that archive file 


1. Creation of Archive File 
We can group multiple files and directories into a single archive file by using tar command. 
tar ðŸ¡ª tape archive 
A) To create tar file 
tar -cvf demo.tar file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt 
tar -cvf demo.tar * 


B) To display table of contents of tar file 
tar -tvf demo.tar 


C) To Extract contents of tar file 
tar -xvf demo.tar 


2. Apply Compression Algorithms on that Archive File: 


There are multiple compression and decompression algorithms. 
1. gzip ðŸ¡ª It is very fast but less compression power 
2. bzip2 ðŸ¡ª It is a bit slow but more compression power 


Compression and Decompression by using gzip: 
1. To Compress tar file 
$ gzip demo.tar 
demo.tar.gz ðŸ¡ª This file got created 


2. To uncompress gz file: 
$ gzip -d demo.tar.gz OR $ gunzip demo.tar.gz 
ðŸ¡ª This command will provide our original tar file
 

How to create tar File and compress in a Single Command: 
1. By using gzip compression algorithm 
To create tar and then compress 
$ tar -cvzf demo.tar *.txt 
z option will do compression 
demo.tar will be created and it is already compressed 

To uncompress and extract tar file 
$ tar -xvzf demo.tar 


Use Case: Backup of Total User Home Directory 


$ tar -cvzf backup.tar * 
$mkdir newhome 
$mv backup.tar newhome 
$cd newhome 
$ tar -xvzf backup.tar
