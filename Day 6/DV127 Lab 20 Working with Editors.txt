Lab 20 Working with Editors




We can use editors to edit file content. 
There are multiple editors available. 


1) vi editor 
2) nano editor 


1. Working with vi Editor: 

vi means visual editor. 
We can use vi to create new files and to edit content of the existing files. 


$ vi file1.txt 


If file1.txt is not available, then a new file will be created and opened that file for editing purpose. 


To save this empty file we should use :wq (w means save and q means exit) 
If the file already contains some data then editor will be opened that file and ready for edit. 


How to edit the File: 
There are 3 types of modes in file editing 


1) Command Mode: 
* It is the default mode. 
* Here we can use any vi command. 
* From command mode, we can enter into insert mode by using multiple ways, but mostly by using i. 


 2) Insert Mode OR Input Mode: 
* In this mode, we can modify file data. We can insert/append new data. 
* From insert mode, we can enter into command mode by using <Esc> key. 


3) Exit Mode: 
* To quit from the editor. 
* From the command mode we have to press: then we can enter into exit mode.
