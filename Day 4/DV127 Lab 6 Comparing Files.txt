Lab 6 Comparing Files


We can compare data of two files by using the following commands: 
1) cmp 
2) diff 
3) sdiff 
4) vidiff 
5) comm 


1) cmp Comamnd: 


It will compare byte by byte. 
cmp file1.txt file2.txt 
If content is same then we won't get any output. 
If the content is different, then it provides information about only first difference. byte number and line number will be provided. 

Note: cmp command won't show all differences and show only first difference. 


2) diff Comamnd: 


It will show all differences in the content. 
diff file1.txt file2.txt 
If the content is the same then no output. 
If the content is different then it will show all differences. 


For the diff command we can use the following options. 


-q shows message when files are different. 


-s shows message when files are same | identical 


-y shows comparison line by line (parallel comparison) 


If we want to suppress common lines then we should use --suppress-common-lines option with -y option. 
$ diff -y --suppress-common-lines file1.txt file2.txt

3) sdiff Command: 


We can use sdiff command for side by side comparison (parallel comparison) 
$ sdiff a.txt b.txt 
  
Note: sdiff comamnd and diff command with -y option are same.


4) vimdiff Command: 


* It will highlight differences in vim. 
* To support this command, we have to install vim by using the following command. 
* sudo apt install vim 


* vimdiff a.txt b.txt
* ctrl+w+w ðŸ¡ª To go to next window 
* :q ðŸ¡ª Close current window 
* :qa ðŸ¡ª Close all windows 
* :qa! ðŸ¡ª Close all windows forcely. 


5) comm Command: 
By using this command we can compare data of two files. 
comm filea.txt fileb.txt

 Note: We can compare files from various builds by using our comparison commands (cmp, diff, sdiff, vimdiff, comm).
