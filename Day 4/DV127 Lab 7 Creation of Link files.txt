Lab 7 Creation of Link files




There are 2 types of link files 


1) Hard Link files 
2) Soft Link files 


1. Hard Link Files: 


It is just another name of the same exact file. 
We can create hard link file by using ln command. 
ln originalfile hardlinkfile 


Eg: ln a.txt c.txt 
Here a.txt is original file and b.txt is hard link file. 

Important conclusions about hard link file: 


1) Both original file and hardlink file have same inode number, same size, same timestamp. 
2) If we delete original file, then there is no effect on hardlink file. 


2. Soft Link File: 


* A softlink is a pointer to another file. It is just like windows shortcut. 
* It is also known as symbolic link. 
* We can create soft link file by using ln command but with -s option. 
* ln -s originalfile softlinkfile 

Eg: ln -s file1.txt file2.txt 
Here file1.txt is original file and file2.txt is link file. 

Important conclusions about softlink file: 
1) Original file and softlink file have different inode numbers, different file sizes and different timestamps. 
2) Usually softlink file has smaller file size than original file size. 
3) If we delete original file then softlink files will become useless. 


Link files for directories: 


We cannot create hardlink for directories because it breaks Linux File System. Having two root directories is meaningless. 


$ ln dir1 dir2 
ln: dir1: hard link not allowed for directory 
We can create softlink for directories 
$ ln -s dir1 dir2 

Note: For files we can create both hard and soft links. But for directories we can create only softlinks butnot hardlinks. 


Case Study: 
Assume dir1 contains dir2. 
dir2 contains softlink dir3 pointing to dir1 
dir1 ðŸ¡ª dir2 ðŸ¡ª dir3 


$ mkdir -p dir1/dir2 
$ cd dir1/dir2 
$ ln -s ~/Desktop/dir1 dir3 
It will form a loop. 


Note: While creating link files there may be a chance of forming loops. Take a bit special care.
