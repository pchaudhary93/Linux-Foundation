Lab 9 Sorting Content of the file




We can sort data of the file by using sort command. 
sort filename
 
Here sorting is based on alphabetical order. 


$ sort file1.txt


If we want to sort based on reverse of alphabetical order, then we should use -r option. 
$ sort -r a.txt 

If the file contains alphanumeric data, then first numbers will be considered and then alphabet symbols. 

If the file contains only numbers, then the sorting is not based on numeric value and it is just based on digits. 

If we want to sort based on numeric value then we have to use -n option. 
-n means numeric value

Bydefault sort command will display duplicate lines. If we want only unique lines then we have to use -u option. 
-u meant for unique lines. 

Note: We can use -ur and -un options also. 

Sorting Tabular Data by using -k option: 
-k means KEYDEF (key definition). Based on which key (column) we have to sort. 

Sort based on file size in ascending order: 
$ ls -l /etc | head -10 | sort -k 5n 


Sort based on Month: 
6th column provides total date. If we want consider only month then we should use M. 
$ ls -l /etc | head -10 |sort -k 6M 


Sort based on number of links in descending order: 
$ ls -l /etc | head -10 |sort -k 2nr
