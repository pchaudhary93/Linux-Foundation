Lab 10 Find Unique Content in the File by using uniq Command


We can use uniq command to display unique content in the file. 
But to use uniq command, compulsory the file should be sorted, otherwise it won't work properly. 




$ cat a.txt 


$ uniq a.txt 


$ sort a.txt | uniq 


With uniq command we can use multiple options: 


-d ðŸ¡ª To display only duplicate lines 
-c ðŸ¡ª To display number of occurrences of each line 
-i ðŸ¡ª Ignore case while comparing 
-u ðŸ¡ª To display only unique lines i.e the lines which are not duplicated.


1. To display only duplicate lines: 
$ sort a.txt | uniq -d 


2. To display number of occurrences of each line: 
$ sort a.txt | uniq â€“c


3. To ignore case while comparing: 
$ sort a.txt | uniq -i 

$ sort a.txt | uniq -ic 


4. To display only unique lines i.e the lines which are not duplicated: 
$ sort a.txt | uniq -u
